# 0001-record-architecture-decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Software architecture decisions are often made during development but are not formally documented. This can lead to a loss of institutional knowledge, inconsistent approaches, and challenges for new team members trying to understand the rationale behind the system's design. Without a clear record, the context for specific design choices can be forgotten, leading to costly re-evaluations or deviations from established patterns.

## Decision

We will adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as a lightweight mechanism to document significant architectural decisions. Each ADR will be a short Markdown file stored alongside the code in a dedicated `docs/adr` directory. New ADRs will be created for any decision that has a significant impact on the project's structure, technology choices, or long-term maintainability.

ADRs will follow a standardized template (inspired by Michael Nygard's approach) and will be version-controlled with the codebase. This ensures that decisions and their context are easily accessible and remain synchronized with the evolving project.

## Consequences

### Positive

* **Improved Knowledge Transfer:** New team members can quickly understand the rationale behind key architectural choices.
* **Consistency:** Encourages consistent application of design principles across the project.
* **Accountability:** Provides a clear record of decisions, making it easier to track and understand the evolution of the system.
* **Reduced Rework:** Avoids re-litigating past decisions due to forgotten context.
* **Enhanced Collaboration:** Facilitates discussion and review of significant decisions.

### Negative

* **Initial Overhead:** Requires a small amount of effort to write and maintain ADRs.
* **Potential for Stale Docs:** If not diligently maintained, ADRs can become outdated, though this is mitigated by being version-controlled.
