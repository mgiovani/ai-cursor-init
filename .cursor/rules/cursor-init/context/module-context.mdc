When the user asks about the cursor-init project structure, modules, or implementation details, I should provide context about:

**Core Components:**
- `.cursor/rules/` - Contains Cursor-specific rules for slash commands
- `templates/` - Pre-populated documentation templates organized by type
- `cli/` - CLI tool source code for non-interactive usage
- `docs/` - Project documentation and examples

**Key Modules:**
- Slash command rules (init-docs, update-docs, adr, etc.)
- Template library with variants for different frameworks
- CLI with init, update, and check subcommands
- Language/framework detection and preset logic
- Mermaid diagram generation capabilities

**Architecture:**
- In-IDE functionality via Cursor rules and AI tools
- CLI tool for CI integration and offline usage
- Template-based document generation
- Automated diagram creation from code analysis
- Framework-specific customization (Python/FastAPI, TypeScript/React)

This is an open-source documentation framework designed to work seamlessly within Cursor IDE.
