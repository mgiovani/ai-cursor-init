  "I will analyze the current codebase and documentation to suggest updates.

  1. **Check Documentation Freshness:** I will examine the existing documentation files and compare them with the current codebase state.

  2. **Data Model Analysis:** I will check if `docs/data-model.md` exists and whether SQLAlchemy models have been modified since the last ER diagram generation. If models have changed or if the file doesn't exist, I will suggest running `/gen-er-diagram` to update the data model documentation.

  3. **Architecture Documentation:** I will verify that `docs/architecture.md` reflects the current project structure and technology stack.

  4. **ADR Review:** I will check if any new architectural decisions should be documented based on recent code changes.

  5. **Onboarding Guide:** I will ensure the onboarding documentation is current with the latest setup requirements.

  6. **Missing Documentation Detection:** I will identify any missing core documentation files that should exist based on the project structure.

  7. **Content Staleness Analysis:** I will analyze whether existing documentation content aligns with the current codebase structure and dependencies.

  Let me analyze your project and provide specific recommendations for documentation updates..."

  I will use the `codebase_search`, `list_dir`, `grep_search`, and `read_file` tools to examine the current state and provide a detailed report with specific recommendations for updates.
