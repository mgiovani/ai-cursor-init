  "I will generate an ER diagram from SQLAlchemy models found in your project.

  1. **Scanning for SQLAlchemy Models:** I will search your codebase for SQLAlchemy model definitions using semantic search and grep patterns to find files containing SQLAlchemy declarative base imports and model classes.

  2. **Extracting Schema Information:** I will analyze the found models to extract:
     - Table names and their corresponding classes
     - Column names, data types, and constraints
     - Primary key relationships
     - Foreign key relationships between tables

  3. **Generating Mermaid ER Diagram:** Based on the extracted schema information, I will create a valid Mermaid `erDiagram` with proper syntax for entities, attributes, and relationships.

  4. **Storing the Diagram:** The generated diagram will be saved to `docs/data-model.md`, creating the file if it doesn't exist or overwriting it if it does.

  Let me start by searching for SQLAlchemy models in your project..."

  I will use the `codebase_search` and `grep_search` tools to find SQLAlchemy models, then use `edit_file` to create the ER diagram documentation.
